This package contains the source code of Dimemas simulator and also the 
graphical user interface.

Dependencies
============

   In order to compile the simulator, you need to copy the BSC Performance 
Tools 'common-files' source code directoy at the same level where the 'dimemas'
folder is, or point it using '--with-common-files-dir'.

   You will also need Lex and Yacc compatible packages installed on your system.
Free source versions of this tools can be obtained at:

   * Flex (open source Lex implementation)
        http://flex.sourceforge.net/
        
   * Bison (open source Yacc implementation)
        http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/


   The graphical user interface is codified using Java and packaged as a JAR
file. By this reason, you will need to have installed on your system a JDK
distribuation as well as the Jar Archiver. We tested it the Oracle/Sun Java 
distribution (even not being 100% open source), and we encourage using it. It
can be obtained at:

	* SDN Developer Resources for Java Technology
        http://java.sun.com


Specific Compilation Options
============================

   There is a wide range of compilation options, to fine tune the simulation.
Check 'configure --help' for specific compilation options.

   Most common configuration line is:

   * ./configure --enable-large-traces --with-time-limit=<simulation_limit_in_seconds>

   Other useful options are:

   * --enable-debug: to produce a more accurate description of the simulation

   * --enable-optimization: to compile the simulator with higher compiler
     optimization.

   Rest of the options usually regard to very specific simulation facts.Do not
hesitate to contact us to solve any doubts regarding the specific Dimemas 
tune.
